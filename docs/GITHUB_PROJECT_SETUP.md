# GitHub Project Board Setup

A GitHub Project board is **highly recommended** for tracking multi-agent development. It gives you a visual Kanban board to see exactly what each agent is working on.

## 🎯 Why Use a GitHub Project?

**Benefits:**
- 📊 **Visual progress tracking** - See all agents at a glance
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** - Issues move through columns automatically
- 📈 **Roadmap view** - See timeline and dependencies
- 🤝 **Team coordination** - Perfect for multi-agent workflow
- 📱 **Mobile access** - Check progress from anywhere

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create the Project

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Projects** tab
3. Click **New project** (green button)
4. Choose **Board** template
5. Name it: **"VEP MVP - Multi-Agent Development"**
6. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Configure Columns

GitHub creates default columns. Let's customize them for our workflow:

**Delete default columns and create these:**

1. **🟡 Ready** 
   - Description: "Agent can start work immediately"
   - Automation: None
   
2. **🟠 In Progress**
   - Description: "Agent is currently working on this"
   - Automation: Auto-move when issue assigned
   
3. **👀 Code Review**
   - Description: "PR created, awaiting review"
   - Automation: Auto-move when PR created
   
4. **✅ Testing**
   - Description: "Code merged, CI/CD running"
   - Automation: Auto-move when PR merged
   
5. **🎉 Done**
   - Description: "Agent task complete, PROGRESS.md updated"
   - Automation: Auto-move when issue closed

### Step 3: Add Agent Issues

Create issues for each agent (or I can provide the text):

**Agent 1 - Database Schema**
```
Title: [AGENT 1] Database Schema with PostGIS
Labels: agent-1, database, ready
Column: 🟡 Ready
Estimate: 2-4 hours
```

**Agent 2 - Backend API**
```
Title: [AGENT 2] FastAPI Backend Routes and Models
Labels: agent-2, backend, blocked
Column: 🟡 Ready (but blocked by Agent 1)
Estimate: 1-2 weeks
Depends on: #1
```

**Agent 3 - iOS Frontend**
```
Title: [AGENT 3] SwiftUI Views and ViewModels
Labels: agent-3, ios, blocked
Column: 🟡 Ready (but blocked by Agent 2)
Estimate: 1-2 weeks
Depends on: #2
```

**Agent 4 - Integration**
```
Title: [AGENT 4] Service Layer and Offline Sync
Labels: agent-4, integration, blocked
Column: 🟡 Ready (but blocked by Agent 2 & 3)
Estimate: 1 week
Depends on: #2, #3
```

**Agent 5 - Testing**
```
Title: [AGENT 5] Test Suite and CI/CD
Labels: agent-5, testing, ready
Column: 🟡 Ready (can work in parallel)
Estimate: 1-2 weeks
Depends on: #1 (can start after)
```

### Step 4: Configure Workflows (Automation)

Set up automatic column transitions:

**In Progress:**
- Auto-move when: Issue assigned
- Auto-move when: Label "in-progress" added

**Code Review:**
- Auto-move when: PR linked to issue
- Auto-move when: Label "review" added

**Testing:**
- Auto-move when: PR merged

**Done:**
- Auto-move when: Issue closed
- Auto-move when: Label "completed" added

### Step 5: Add Custom Fields

Make tracking more powerful:

1. Click **Settings** (gear icon in project)
2. Add these custom fields:

**Field: Agent**
- Type: Single select
- Options: Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3, Agent 4, Agent 5

**Field: Estimate**
- Type: Text
- Description: Time estimate (e.g., "2-4 hours", "1 week")

**Field: Blocker**
- Type: Text
- Description: What's blocking this? (e.g., "Waiting for Agent 1")

**Field: Progress**
- Type: Number
- Description: Completion percentage (0-100)

**Field: Priority**
- Type: Single select
- Options: High, Medium, Low

## 📊 Project Views

GitHub Projects supports multiple views. Create these:

### View 1: Board (Default)
Standard Kanban board with columns

### View 2: Timeline
1. Click **+ New view**
2. Choose **Roadmap**
3. Name: "Development Timeline"
4. Shows dependencies and dates visually

### View 3: Table
1. Click **+ New view**
2. Choose **Table**
3. Name: "All Tasks"
4. Shows all issues in spreadsheet format
5. Good for bulk editing

### View 4: Agent Status
1. Click **+ New view**
2. Choose **Board**
3. Group by: "Agent" field
4. Name: "By Agent"
5. Shows each agent's tasks in separate columns

## 🎨 Labels to Create

**Agent Labels:**
- `agent-1` (Color: #0E8A16 - Green)
- `agent-2` (Color: #1D76DB - Blue)
- `agent-3` (Color: #5319E7 - Purple)

- [ ] path/to/file1.ext
- [ ] path/to/file2.ext

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] PROGRESS.md updated

## Dependencies
- Depends on: #Y
- Blocks: #Z

## Progress

```

## 🔄 Workflow Example

Here's how it works in practice:

### Week 1: Agent 1 (Database)

1. **Issue created:** [AGENT 1] Database Schema
   - Starts in: 🟡 Ready
   - Labels: `agent-1`, `database`, `ready`

2. **You assign to yourself:**
   - Auto-moves to: 🟠 In Progress
   - Label changes: `in-progress`

3. **You create branch:** `agent-1/database-schema`
   - Invoke Agent 1 in Cursor
   - Agent generates SQL migration

4. **You create PR:** "feat: Add database schema (Agent 1)"
   - Links to issue
   - Auto-moves to: 👀 Code Review

5. **You merge PR:**
   - Auto-moves to: ✅ Testing
   - CI runs tests

6. **You close issue:**
   - Auto-moves to: 🎉 Done
   - Label: `completed`

7. **You update PROGRESS.md:**
   - Mark Agent 1 complete
   - Agent 2 automatically unblocked

### Week 2: Agent 2 (Backend)

Same process repeats for Agent 2, 3, 4, 5...
