## üß™ Manual Testing Required

### Project Automation Workflow Testing

The following tests should be performed manually to verify the project automation workflow works correctly:

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] Verify a GitHub Project (V2) exists with "VEP" or "MVP" in the name
- [ ] Verify project has a "Status" field
- [ ] Verify Status field has these options: Ready, In Progress, Code Review, Testing, Done
- [ ] Add a test issue to the project board

#### Test Case 1: Issue Opened
1. [ ] Create a new issue
2. [ ] Add it to the project board
3. [ ] Expected: Issue should be in "Ready" status
4. [ ] Check Actions logs for confirmation

#### Test Case 2: Issue Assigned
1. [ ] Assign the issue to someone
2. [ ] Expected: Issue should move to "In Progress"
3. [ ] Expected: Confirmation comment added to issue
4. [ ] Check Actions logs

#### Test Case 3: PR Created
1. [ ] Create a PR that references the issue
2. [ ] Expected: Issue should move to "Code Review"
3. [ ] Expected: Confirmation comment added
4. [ ] Check Actions logs

#### Test Case 4: PR Merged
1. [ ] Merge the PR
2. [ ] Expected: Issue should move to "Testing"
3. [ ] Expected: Confirmation comment added
4. [ ] Check Actions logs

#### Test Case 5: Issue Closed
1. [ ] Close the issue
2. [ ] Expected: Issue should move to "Done"
3. [ ] Expected: Confirmation comment added
4. [ ] Check Actions logs

#### Test Case 6: PR Closed Without Merge
1. [ ] Create a new PR
2. [ ] Close it without merging
3. [ ] Expected: Related issue should move back to "Ready"
4. [ ] Check Actions logs

### Other Workflow Testing

#### Backend CI/Tests
- [ ] Push a change to backend code
- [ ] Verify Backend CI workflow runs
- [ ] Verify Backend Tests workflow runs
- [ ] Check for any failures

#### iOS CI/Tests
- [ ] Push a change to iOS code
- [ ] Verify iOS CI workflow runs
- [ ] Verify iOS Tests workflow runs
- [ ] Check for any failures

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Verify Code Quality workflow runs on schedule
- [ ] Check for any linting errors
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities

#### Deployment
- [ ] Verify Deploy workflow configuration
- [ ] Check deployment prerequisites
- [ ] **Note:** Don't test actual deployment unless ready

#### Release
- [ ] Verify Release workflow configuration
- [ ] **Note:** Don't create actual release unless ready

## üîç What to Look For

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Workflow runs complete without errors
- ‚úÖ Project board items move to correct status
- ‚úÖ Confirmation comments appear on issues/PRs
- ‚úÖ Logs show clear information about what happened
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded values in error messages

### Potential Issues
- ‚ùå "Project not found" errors
- ‚ùå "Status field not found" errors
- ‚ùå "Item not in project" errors
- ‚ùå Workflow doesn't trigger at all
- ‚ùå No confirmation comments

### Debugging
If issues occur:
1. Check Actions tab for workflow runs
2. Review workflow logs in detail
3. Verify project board setup matches prerequisites
4. Check that Status field exists and has correct options
5. Ensure items are added to project before events trigger
