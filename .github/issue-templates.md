```markdown
## Agent Information
**Agent:** Agent 1 - Database Engineer  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Start  
**Estimate:** 2-4 hours  
**Blocker:** None - Can start immediately

## Objective
Create the complete PostgreSQL database schema with PostGIS extension for the VEP MVP, including all tables, indexes, constraints, RLS policies, and triggers.

## Files to Create
- [ ] `backend/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`

## Requirements from spec.md
- Section 2: Complete Database Schema
- Section 2.1: All 5 tables (users, voters, assignments, assignment_voters, contact_logs)
- Section 2.2: Database functions and triggers
- Section 2.3: Row Level Security policies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SQL file runs without errors on PostgreSQL 14+
- [ ] All 5 tables created with correct columns
- [ ] PostGIS extension enabled
- [ ] All indexes created (15+ indexes)

## Dependencies
**Depends on:** None  
**Blocks:** #2 (Agent 2), #5 (Agent 5)

## Cursor Prompt
Copy this prompt from `.copilot/instructions-agent-1.md`:

```
You are Agent 1: Database Engineer.

CRITICAL: Read these files first:
